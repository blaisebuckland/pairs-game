# pairs-game
This is a [memory game](https://blaisebuckland.github.io/pairs-game/) in which the player must find all the matching pairs to win. There are three difficulty levels, each with its own theme. In the higher levels there are more cards to match and it becomes more difficult to differentiate between the images.

## Functionality
* After level selection, each card is randomly given an image from that level's images
* There are two copies of each image across all the cards
* The player selects and turns over two cards per turn
* If the cards do not match, they will be turned back over
* Matched cards remain visible
* A counter keeps track of the number of moves the player has made
* Once all cards have been matched, the player is given the option to play again
