# pairs-game
This is a [memory game](ADD LINK to GAME...blaisebuckland.github.io/calculator/), you have to find all the matching pairs to win. There are three difficulty levels, each with its own theme (sweets, cats and Dolly Parton). In the higher levels there are more cards to match and the images on the cards become more difficult to differentiate between.
